    <h1>What am I in to?</h1>
    <p>I have a wide variety of hobbies/interests. These include; Football, Video Games, My dog Gus and many more. I'm currently on a journey to become a great web developer, and from there who knows where I'll end up. I'm also currently learning guitar which is a nice contrast to coding. If you want to know anything else, then feel free to <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a></p>
